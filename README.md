# GratiGator 🐊 

GratiGator is a daily log-in based venting and gratiude journaling app for students at the University of Florida. By logging entries daily, users are able to accumulate a Duolingo-style streak, and get rewarded on maintaining their journal on the daily. The goal of GratiGator is to improve campus-wide mental health, reminding students that there are good things coming their way admist some stressors and negativity. 

Students will be able to share their gratitudes with their friends, if they choose to do so.
